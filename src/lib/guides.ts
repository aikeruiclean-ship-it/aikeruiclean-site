        content:
          "Floor scrubbers come in two main types: walk-behind and ride-on. Walk-behind scrubbers are ideal for small to medium facilities under 20,000 sq ft, offering maneuverability in tight spaces at a lower cost. Ride-on scrubbers are designed for large industrial spaces over 20,000 sq ft, allowing operators to clean more area in less time with reduced fatigue. For facilities with heavy debris, consider a sweeper-scrubber combination machine that can sweep and scrub in one pass.",
        items: [
          "Walk-behind: Best for 5,000–20,000 sq ft spaces, tight aisles, lower budget",

Lithium batteries cost more initially but offer longer life, no maintenance, faster charging, and lighter weight. For facilities that run multiple shifts, lithium batteries with opportunity charging provide better productivity as they can be charged during breaks without memory effect.",
